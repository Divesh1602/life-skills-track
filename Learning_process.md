## 3. Learn anything in 20 hours

### * According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.

	To learn a process you need 20 hours and those 20 hours are divided into the following:

	1. Find the part of the skill that you find most difficult part of the skill to learn and start with the same. Try to 
	   focus more on that same topic and understanding it. so that's the first part of the learning process i.e. Deconstructing the skill. 
	   
	2. You should learn a specific topic so that even if by any chance you make some mistake then you are able to self-correct it. This
	   is the second part of the learning process i.e. Learning enough to self-correct.
	   
	3. Remove those things that distract you from doing your work even for a minute. So those things that reduce your focus try to step 
	   away from them. This is the third part of the learning process i.e. Removing the practice barriers.
	   
	4. To remove the frustration, doubts, and confusion the best way is to practice. you should practice more on that topic. And this is the final 
	   part of the learning process i.e. Practice at least 20 hours.
	   
	These are the 4 major steps to learn anything in 20 hours.

## 4. Improve yourself
