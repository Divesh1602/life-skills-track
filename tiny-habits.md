## 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg

### **Question 1.** In this video(by BJ Fogg), what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
Habits don't form quickly; you need to do them regularly. Think about your life, figure out what you want to change, break it into small steps, and make sure you do them consistently. And when you achieve these small steps, celebrate a little!

### **Question 2.** How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?
**B = MAP** means that your behavior depends on how motivated you are, your ability to do something, and having a trigger or reminder to do it. To develop a habit, start with tasks that don't require much motivation and are easy to do, and then gradually increase the complexity as you work on making it a habit.


### **Question 3.** Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)
Feeling good after doing something well is called 'shine.' The more we cheer and feel happy about small achievements, the faster we get used to them. When we celebrate even small successes, it boosts our motivation and confidence. This shows that what's important is how often we succeed, not how big the success is.
