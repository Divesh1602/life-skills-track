# Good Practices for Software Development
## Which point(s) were new to you?
* Sometimes despite all efforts, the requirements are still vague. So during the implementation phase, get frequent feedback so that you are on track and everyone is on the same page.
* Use the group chat/channels to communicate most of the time. This is preferable over private DMs simply because there are more eyes on the main channel.
* Remote work is still work.
* Remember they have their own work to do as well. Pick and choose your communication medium depending on the situation
* Be available when someone replies to your message. Things move faster if it's a real-time conversation as compared to a back and forth every hour.

## Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?
* I need to learn how to stay focused for long on a particular task.
  * Reduce the number of breaks.
  * Will keep my phone on silent mode.
  * Try to remove the distractions in my surroundings.

* Try to speak more
    * I hesitate to start conversation, so will work on that.
    * Try to be more interactive in session.

* Try to understand a topic properly instead of taking a idea.
    * Will try to ask more practical questions about that topic
    * Will try to learn those technlogies that are widely used in industries.
